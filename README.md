The Car Parking Sensor project uses an ATmega32 microcontroller and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure distances to obstacles. It displays the distance on a 16x2 LCD and uses LEDs and a buzzer to signal proximity. This system improves parking safety by providing real-time feedback to drivers, helping to prevent collisions
